## Module Federation by Jack Herrington

### Share components between different projects. Very useful in cases where different teams work in different projects, but sharing components.

1. Run the command npx create-mf-app for remote app
2. Run the command npx create-mf-app for host app
3. Expose the required component in the webpack config in the remote app
4. Import the required component in the webpack config in the host app
